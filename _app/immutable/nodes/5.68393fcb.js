      dear customer, we want to ensure your treasured macrame doll remains as beautiful and enchanting as the day you brought it home.
      caring for these delicate creations is a breeze, and we&#39;re here to share a few simple tips to help you keep them in pristine condition.
      <br/><br/> <b>1. Handle with care:</b> macrame dolls are delicate and require gentle handling. avoid tugging or pulling on the knots and fibers, as this may cause damage.
      treat them with love and care, just as you would with any precious keepsake.
      <br/><br/> <b>2. brushing out the beauty:</b> give your macrame doll some extra love by brushing it gently with a soft-bristled brush. 
      this helps maintain its shape and removes any loose fibers or dust that may accumulate over time. a light brushing once in a while will keep your doll looking fresh and vibrant.
      <br/><br/> <b>3. keep away from moisture:</b> while macrame dolls are resilient, it&#39;s best to keep them away from excessive moisture to avoid any potential damage.
      avoid placing them in damp or humid areas, and ensure they are stored in a dry, well-ventilated space.
      <br/><br/> <b>4. display with care:</b> when showcasing your macrame doll, choose a spot away from direct sunlight, as prolonged exposure may cause fading or discoloration.
      Additionally, avoid displaying them near sources of heat or open flames to prevent any potential hazards.
      <br/><br/>
      by following these simple guidelines, you can ensure your macrame doll remains a captivating piece of art, radiating its charm and beauty.
      embrace the delicate nature of these creations and let them continue to bring magic into your life.
